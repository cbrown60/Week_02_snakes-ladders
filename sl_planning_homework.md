Plan out how you might model the game of Snakes and Ladders. Break it down into its smallest components and think what classes you might need to model these, and what some of the properties and methods of those classes could be. Also think about how the classes might interact with each other. 

Here's a description of the game from Wikipedia. Hint: - nouns may be turned into classes or properties, verbs may be methods. 

"Snakes and Ladders is an ancient Indian board game regarded today as a worldwide classic. It is played between two or more players on a gameboard having numbered, gridded squares. A number of "ladders" and "snakes" are pictured on the board, each connecting two specific board squares. The object of the game is to navigate one's game piece, according to die rolls, from the start (bottom square) to the finish (top square), helped or hindered by ladders and snakes respectively."
